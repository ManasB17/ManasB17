## ✨Here is a little about me!
              
I'm Manas Bhattarai!  
Machine Learning Engineer 🧑‍💻 with 1 year of experience.

I have **worked on** 👨‍💻:
- Resaerch of various open-source foundational model to check feasibility for different downstream tasks.
- Research of training process which are efficient and with low computation cost.
- Further investigate on pre-training and fine-tuning techniques like DAPT(Domain Adaptive Pre-Trainig) and PEFT(Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning) as a follow through of previous research.
- Research on Reinforcement Learning from human Feedback(RLHF).
- Research on popular Opensource LLM dataset to understand the structure and how can it be created
- Machine Experiment of techniques like DAPT and PEFT to draw conclusions.
- Performed Prompt Engineering Techniques for better content generation.
- Performed RAG to generate more accurate results.
- Research various benchmarks to perform evaluation. 

**💻Currently: I am learning**
- Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Reinforcement Learning from human Feedback(RLHF)
- Retrival Augment Generation in LLMs
- Handling Large context in LLMs
- Prompt Engineering.
